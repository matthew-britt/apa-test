Human Animal Support Services (HASS) is a project launched by a coalition of leaders from animal welfare organizations across the country (including Austin Pets Alive!). HASS pilot animal shelters work with organizations and individuals in their own communities to provide a range of serices and solutions to aid people and animals. Their idea is that animal services should turn from historically inward-facing (where the majority of efforts are facility-based) to outward-facing efforts to support animal welfare in the community.

As the HASS project grows nationally, new working groups are being continuously added to handle challenges and seize opportunities. My task is to create a quick and easy template to build a Google Site page for each new working group.

Working group info (including member names, lead contacts, objectives, and document/email links) is stored in an Airtable database. I use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to design a web app that pulls working group info from the Airtable and display it on a site hosted by Github pages. That URL can then be embedded directly into Google Sites. By simply adding the working group name as a search param to the end of the URL (e.g., `URL/?Tools+and+Technology` or `URL/?Research`), all working group info can quickly be displayed, published, and shared amongst members.
